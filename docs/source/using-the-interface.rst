*. You can configure what links are available and what order they are in by clicking the |gear| icon in the top right of each section.
   *. Provide more detailed instructions on how to add links to main menu, see page 102.

   *. If you've removed items from the main menu and want to restore them, you can click the *Merge Default* or *Restore Default* at the top of the setup screen.
      *. Merge Default combines the default settings with your current settings, maintaining any changes while bringing back any removed options.
	  *. Restore Default removes all menu items that have been manually added and restores the default ones.
